# Pricing Justification Proof Pack (Buyer-Grade)

**Purpose:** provide procurement- and CFO-grade proof that FormaOS can sustain pricing at **$249 / $499 / $899+ per month** based on quantified labor savings, risk reduction, and procurement readiness.

**Scope note:** this pack is designed to be shared externally. It avoids internal-only implementation details and does not rely on feature checklists as “proof”.

## What’s Included

1. `proof-pack/ROI_PROOF.md`
   - ROI model for 3 customer sizes (NDIS small, aged care mid-size, multi-site org)
   - Hours saved per month (by work category) and $ savings (AU wage bands)

   - 5 before/after proof narratives
   - Each includes mechanism, KPI, and timeframe to enable measurable customer validation

3. `proof-pack/PROCUREMENT_TRUST_CENTER_KIT.md`
   - Trust center content kit (security posture, data handling, access controls, audit logging)
   - Templates: subprocessors, incident response, uptime/SLA, DPA outline

   - 25 procurement questions with buyer-safe answers (no over-claims)

5. `proof-pack/COMPETITIVE_POSITIONING.md`

   - “What you can prove in 14 days” checklist
   - Dashboard view spec: what a buyer will see and what can be exported/shared

7. `proof-pack/PRICING_CONFIDENCE.md`
   - Pricing confidence score per tier (0-10)
   - What must ship to confidently charge **$899+**
   - Claims to remove/qualify immediately (to protect trust and procurement momentum)

8. `proof-pack/PROCUREMENT_JUSTIFICATION_1PAGER.md`
   - Internal purchase justification (problem, ROI, risk, implementation plan, contract asks)

9. `proof-pack/ROI_CALCULATOR_DEFAULTS.json`
   - Default inputs and scenario baselines for implementing the website ROI calculator

## How To Use This In Sales (Suggested Motion)

1. **First call:** lead with `ROI_PROOF.md` (pick the closest segment; use conservative wage band first).
2. **Second touch:** send `OUTCOME_PROOF.md` and ask the buyer which KPI matters (time-to-audit, evidence quality, incident traceability, training compliance).
3. **Security review:** send `PROCUREMENT_TRUST_CENTER_KIT.md` + `SECURITY_REVIEW_FAQ.md` as the “fast lane”.
4. **Pilot:** run `ACTIVATION_PROOF_14_DAYS.md` and deliver the proof packet by Day 14.
