# Activation Proof (14-Day Evidence) | Checklist + Dashboard View

This defines a **proof-based activation** that can be executed in a 14-day pilot. The goal is to produce exportable, defensible artifacts procurement and auditors care about.

---

## A) What You Can Prove In 14 Days (Checklist)

### 1) Minimum Evidence Mapped

- Primary framework selected and enabled (SOC 2-aligned / ISO 27001-aligned / NDIS / aged care governance)
- Top-risk control domains identified (the “first 20% that drives 80% of scrutiny”)
- Minimum evidence mapped:
  - **At least 25 evidence items** uploaded or linked
  - **At least 15 controls** mapped to evidence
  - **At least 10 evidence items** reviewed/approved (to prove governance, not just storage)

**Proof artifact:** “Evidence register export” + mapping summary.

### 2) First Executive Report Generated

- Posture summary produced (what’s implemented, what’s missing, what’s high-risk)
- A single-page executive narrative created for CFO/COO

**Proof artifact:** exported executive posture report (PDF or equivalent).

### 3) Register Compliance Baseline Established

- Workforce credential/training baseline captured (even if incomplete)
- Exception list generated (expired, missing, overdue)
- Governance cadence established (weekly review + monthly report)

**Proof artifact:** “Registers baseline export” + exception list.

### 4) Incident Workflow Demonstrated (End-to-End)

- Create 1 representative incident
- Assign an owner and due date
- Capture follow-up actions
- Close with an auditable remediation note

**Proof artifact:** incident summary + linked follow-ups + closure record export.

### 5) Audit Trail Demonstrated (Defensibility)

- Demonstrate “who did what, when” across:
  - evidence upload + approval
  - policy review or update event
  - incident creation + closure
  - report export event

**Proof artifact:** audit log export covering the pilot window.

## B) 14-Day Execution Plan (Operational)

**Day 1-2: Baseline**
- Confirm the buyer’s top audit/regulator outcomes
- Enable primary framework and create initial ownership map
- Import initial policy set and artifacts (do not aim for perfection)

**Day 3-5: Map**
- Map evidence to highest-risk controls first
- Establish review/approval workflow for evidence
- Create the initial exception list (missing/expired/overdue)

**Day 6-8: Operationalize**
- Set recurring governance tasks (policy review cadence, training refresh, credential renewals)
- Set incident follow-up standards (owner + due date + closure narrative)

**Day 9-11: Reporting**
- Generate executive posture report
- Validate traceability end-to-end (artifact -> mapping -> approval -> export)

**Day 12-14: Deliver Proof Packet**
- Export: evidence register, posture report, register baseline, incident chain, audit logs
- Present the proof packet to procurement/security/compliance stakeholders
