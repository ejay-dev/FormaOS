# Competitive Proof (Outcome Positioning) | Vanta / Drata / Secureframe / Sprinto

This draft is written to avoid defamation and avoid feature-checklist battles. It anchors on outcomes, adoption reality, and vertical fit for healthcare/NDIS.

## 1) The Outcome Lens (How Buyers Actually Decide)

Compliance software is typically purchased for one (or more) of these outcomes:

- **Audit cycle compression:** fewer weeks of scramble, fewer internal hours, fewer rework loops
- **Evidence defensibility:** approvals, timestamps, ownership, and “what changed” are provable
- **Operational compliance:** compliance becomes part of daily work, not a separate spreadsheet ritual
- **Procurement acceleration:** security reviews and questionnaires become repeatable, not bespoke

**FormaOS positioning:** FormaOS is designed to behave like a **compliance operating system**. It focuses on turning operational work into defensible proof, especially in regulated service delivery environments (healthcare, NDIS, aged care).

## 2) Why Healthcare/NDIS Needs Different Workflows

Most generic compliance programs assume a “central security team + IT controls” model.

Healthcare/NDIS/aged care compliance behaves differently:
- frontline work generates the evidence (care interactions, incidents, service logs)
- workforce credentials and training expiry are existential (operations stop when lapses occur)
- incidents require traceability to remediation under regulator scrutiny
- multi-site organizations fail audits due to inconsistent execution across sites

**Implication:** Buyers in these verticals need workflows that create proof as a byproduct of operations, not only “security posture paperwork”.

## 3) Competitive Comparison (Outcomes, Not Features)

### A) Audit Prep Compression

**Buyer question:** “How many internal hours does audit season consume, and can we reduce it materially?”

FormaOS outcome narrative:
- compress audit prep by reducing evidence chase, version confusion, and ownership ambiguity
- make audit bundles and stakeholder packs repeatable deliverables

### B) Evidence Defensibility

**Buyer question:** “Can we prove governance, not just store documents?”

FormaOS outcome narrative:
- focuses on traceability: who approved what, when it was reviewed, and what changed
- reduces “unverifiable evidence” findings that create audit churn and remediation loops

### C) Operational Compliance (Frontline Adoption)

**Buyer question:** “Will staff actually use this, or will compliance stay in spreadsheets?”

FormaOS outcome narrative:
- built to connect day-to-day work to audit proof
- reduces double entry and manual reconciliation

### D) Procurement Acceleration

**Buyer question:** “Can we get through security review without 6 weeks of back-and-forth?”

FormaOS outcome narrative:
- standard trust packet and clear “aligned vs certified” wording
- reduces questionnaire churn by providing a consistent security posture narrative and artifacts

## 4) How To Talk About Pricing (Anchors Without Claims)

Avoid competitor price claims. Use buyer-grade anchors:

- **Headcount anchor:** 0.5 to 1.0 FTE of compliance capacity is materially more expensive than $249-$899/month.
- **Consulting anchor:** audit readiness and remediation support often costs tens of thousands per year.
- **Revenue anchor:** enterprise procurement delays can push revenue recognition by weeks or months.

**Safe line:**
> “The cost of the software is typically small relative to the cost of audit prep labor, consulting, and procurement delays.”

## 5) Suggested “Why FormaOS” Copy Block (Website-Ready)

**Headline:**  
“Built for regulated service delivery, not just security paperwork.”

**Body:**  
“If your compliance program touches frontline operations, workforce credentials, incident follow-ups, and multi-site governance, generic compliance tooling can leave you with evidence sprawl and audit-season chaos. FormaOS is designed to turn daily work into defensible proof and deliver procurement-ready artifacts in weeks.”

**CTA:**  
“Run the 14-day proof pilot.”
