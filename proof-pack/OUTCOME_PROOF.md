# Outcome Proof (Before/After) | 5 Buyer-Grade Narratives

These narratives are structured to be measurable. Each one is designed to be validated in a pilot (14-30 days) and then converted into a quantified case study.

## 1) Audit Prep Compression

**Before (pain):** Audit readiness is a scramble. Evidence and approvals are scattered across email, folders, and spreadsheets. Audit prep becomes a multi-week “project” that depends on a few key people.

**After (outcome):** Audit prep shifts from “project mode” to “continuous readiness”. Audit bundles can be produced on demand and the audit becomes confirmation work, not investigation.

**Mechanism (what causes it):** A single system of record for controls, evidence status, and governance activity, with exports gated by readiness checks and traceable actions.

**Metric (measurable KPI):** Audit prep labor hours per audit cycle (or per month, amortized).

**Timeframe:** 30 days (pilot), with the first proof packet delivered in 14 days.

## 2) Evidence Chase Reduction (Cross-Team)

**Before (pain):** Compliance teams spend a disproportionate amount of time chasing people for artifacts and reconciling versions (is this the latest policy? who approved it? when was it reviewed?).

**After (outcome):** Evidence request volume falls because the evidence is current, owned, and already mapped to what auditors will ask for.

**Mechanism (what causes it):** Evidence intake + verification workflow with durable timestamps and ownership, combined with a control/evidence mapping model that surfaces what’s missing early.

**Metric (measurable KPI):** Hours/month spent on evidence follow-ups + number of “evidence missing” escalations per month.

**Timeframe:** 14-30 days.

## 3) Register Compliance Baseline (Training/Credentials/Assets)

**Before (pain):** Training, credential expiries, and asset registers live in spreadsheets. Updates are inconsistent; reminders are manual; gaps are only discovered when an audit or incident forces scrutiny.

**After (outcome):** Registers become a continuously maintained baseline with automated reminders and clear exception lists.

**Mechanism (what causes it):** Centralized registers with recurring governance tasks and exception reporting (what’s expiring, what’s missing, what’s overdue).

**Metric (measurable KPI):** % of workforce with in-date mandatory credentials/training; number of expired items at any point in time.

**Timeframe:** 30 days to establish baseline; 60-90 days to show sustained improvement.

## 4) Incident-to-Remediation Traceability

**Before (pain):** Incidents are logged, but follow-up actions and corrective measures are not consistently linked. Under audit or regulator review, you can’t show a defensible chain from incident to closure.

**After (outcome):** Every incident has an accountable owner, follow-up actions, due dates, and an auditable closure narrative.

**Mechanism (what causes it):** Incident workflow that creates linked actions and captures governance activity as a durable audit trail.

**Metric (measurable KPI):** Median time-to-close incidents; % of incidents with complete follow-up and closure evidence.

**Timeframe:** 14 days to demonstrate the workflow; 30-60 days for measurable closure-time impact.

## 5) Procurement Acceleration (Security Review Fast Lane)

**Before (pain):** Enterprise deals stall in procurement. Security questionnaires are duplicated work. Stakeholders ask for the same documents repeatedly. Sales cycles extend due to incomplete or inconsistent responses.

**After (outcome):** Procurement review becomes a bounded, repeatable process with a standard packet and clear “aligned vs certified” wording.

**Mechanism (what causes it):** A standardized Trust Packet and Trust Center narrative that consolidates security posture, data handling, subprocessors, and control mapping summaries.

**Metric (measurable KPI):** Days from security review start to approval; number of back-and-forth requests from procurement/security.

**Timeframe:** 14 days (deliver the first packet), 30 days (measure cycle-time reduction across 1-2 opportunities).
