# Procurement Justification (1-Pager) | FormaOS

**Request:** Approve FormaOS subscription (monthly)  
**Tier:** $249 / $499 / $899+ (select based on org size and procurement requirements)

---

## Business Problem

Our compliance program currently incurs avoidable cost and risk due to:

- audit readiness being “project-based” (scramble cycles)
- evidence scattered across tools and people
- limited defensibility: unclear approvals, ownership, and timelines
- repeated procurement/security questionnaire effort
- key-person risk (knowledge and artifacts live in inboxes/spreadsheets)

---

## Financial Justification (Conservative)

**Primary driver:** internal labor savings from reduced evidence chase, audit prep compression, and continuous register maintenance.

**Model inputs (set per org):**
- Hours saved/month: ________
- Loaded hourly cost (AU): $55 / $75 / $110

**Estimated monthly labor savings:** `hours_saved * loaded_rate` = ________

**Subscription cost:** ________

**Net monthly value:** `savings - subscription` = ________

**Payback period:** typically < 1 month if savings exceed ~7-15 hours/month (depending on tier).

## Risk Justification

FormaOS reduces risk by improving:

- evidence defensibility (approvals, timestamps, ownership)
- audit response speed and completeness
- register compliance (training/credentials/assets) to reduce operational lapses
- incident-to-remediation traceability under regulator/auditor scrutiny

This reduces the probability and cost of:
- extended audits and remediation loops
- delayed enterprise procurement approvals
- regulator scrutiny escalation due to incomplete follow-up evidence

---

## Implementation Plan (Proof-Based)

**14-day pilot outcome:** deliver a proof packet containing:
- minimum evidence mapped and approved (defensible)
- first executive posture report
- register compliance baseline + exceptions list
- one incident demonstrated end-to-end with remediation chain
- audit trail extract for pilot window

**30-day outcome:** establish cadence:
- weekly compliance review
- monthly governance report

---

## Procurement / Contract Asks (Enterprise)

If required by procurement:
- security packet + trust center documentation set
- subprocessors list + update process
- incident response and notification terms
- uptime/SLA terms (enterprise only)
- SSO requirements and timelines (if required)

---

## Decision Owners

- **Business owner:** COO / Compliance Lead
- **Financial approver:** CFO
- **Security approver:** Security Lead / IT Manager
