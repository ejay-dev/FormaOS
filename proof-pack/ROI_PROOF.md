# ROI Proof (Numbers) | AU Models For $249 / $499 / $899+

This document provides a buyer-grade ROI model for three common buyer profiles in Australia:

1. **Small NDIS provider**
2. **Mid-size aged care provider**
3. **Multi-site regulated org (NDIS/healthcare/general)**

It is deliberately conservative and focuses on *operational labor savings* first. Consulting savings and downside-risk avoided are included as optional add-ons to avoid credibility loss.

## 1) Wage Assumptions (Australia)

### 1.1 “Loaded” Hourly Cost (Low / Median / High)

We model ROI using **loaded hourly cost**, not base wages, because audit readiness work consumes:
- salary (or contractor rates)
- super + leave + payroll overhead
- management and coordination time

**Reference anchor:** ABS Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings (AWOTE) for full-time adults is approximately **AUD $2,010/week** (May 2025, trend). That implies roughly **$52.9/hour** at 38 hours/week before loading.

**Recommended loaded bands for CFO-safe ROI models:**
- **Low:** **$55/hour** (admin-heavy workload)
- **Median:** **$75/hour** (blended compliance + ops)
- **High:** **$110/hour** (compliance lead + managers + exec review time)

## 2) ROI Model: 3 Customer Sizes (Hours Saved -> $ Saved)

### Shared Definitions

**Work categories (monthly hours saved):**
- **Audit prep (amortized):** external audit readiness work spread across months
- **Evidence collection:** chasing, reconciling, and validating artifacts across teams/tools
- **Training/register tracking:** staff training, credentials, assets/register upkeep and reminders
- **Incident reporting:** logging, follow-ups, remediation, and regulator/auditor traceability
- **Reporting:** exec/procurement updates, posture summaries, stakeholder packs

**Pricing tiers (your target pricing proof):**
- **$249/month:** small operator plan
- **$499/month:** mid-market plan
- **$899+/month:** enterprise / multi-site plan (often includes onboarding + governance cadence)

---

## 2.1 Small NDIS Provider (Example Model)

**Profile (typical):**
- 25-50 staff, single site, regulated by NDIS Commission requirements
- Compliance work performed by a coordinator plus ops/management time
- Audit effort spikes around renewal/assessment windows

**Conservative hours saved per month (estimate):**
- Audit prep (amortized): **8**
- Evidence collection/mapping: **12**
- Training/register tracking: **6**
- Incident reporting + follow-up: **4**
- Reporting + stakeholder updates: **2**

**Total hours saved per month:** **32**

**$ savings per month (labor only):**
- Low ($55/h): **$1,760**
- Median ($75/h): **$2,400**
- High ($110/h): **$3,520**

**Net value after subscription:**
- At **$249/month**: **$1,511 to $3,271 / month** net

**ROI multiple (labor only):**
- **7.1x to 14.1x** monthly ROI vs $249

**Buyer-safe summary sentence:**
> “Even with conservative assumptions, FormaOS typically pays for itself if it saves ~5 hours/week of compliance admin and audit prep.”

## 2.2 Mid-Size Aged Care Provider (Example Model)

**Profile (typical):**
- 150-300 staff, 1-3 facilities, structured accreditation/governance demands
- Significant ongoing training/compliance register maintenance
- Incidents and corrective actions require strong traceability

**Conservative hours saved per month (estimate):**
- Audit prep (amortized): **25**
- Evidence collection/mapping: **45**
- Training/register tracking: **35**
- Incident reporting + follow-up: **20**
- Reporting + stakeholder updates: **10**

**Total hours saved per month:** **135**

**$ savings per month (labor only):**
- Low ($55/h): **$7,425**
- Median ($75/h): **$10,125**
- High ($110/h): **$14,850**

**Net value after subscription:**
- At **$499/month**: **$6,926 to $14,351 / month** net

**ROI multiple (labor only):**
- **14.9x to 29.8x** monthly ROI vs $499

**Buyer-safe summary sentence:**
> “At aged care scale, the ROI is usually driven by training/compliance registers and incident traceability, not ‘audit season’ alone.”

---

## 2.3 Multi-Site Regulated Org (Example Model)

**Profile (typical):**
- 700-2,000 staff, 5-20 sites/entities
- Compliance work is distributed across sites, but audits require centralized defensible proof
- Procurement and governance reporting is more frequent and more formal

**Conservative hours saved per month (estimate):**
- Audit prep (amortized): **70**
- Evidence collection/mapping: **220**
- Training/register tracking: **160**
- Incident reporting + follow-up: **80**
- Reporting + stakeholder updates: **30**

**Total hours saved per month:** **560**

**$ savings per month (labor only):**
- Low ($55/h): **$30,800**
- Median ($75/h): **$42,000**
- High ($110/h): **$61,600**

**Net value after subscription:**
- At **$899/month**: **$29,901 to $60,701 / month** net

**ROI multiple (labor only):**
- **34.3x to 68.5x** monthly ROI vs $899

**Buyer-safe summary sentence:**
> “Multi-site ROI is mostly ‘evidence sprawl reduction’: fewer escalations, fewer rework loops, faster audit response, and less dependence on key people.”

## 3) Optional Add-Ons (Use Only If Buyer Wants It)

These are real value drivers but can trigger scrutiny if stated too aggressively.

### 3.1 Consulting Reduction (Readiness + Audit Prep)

If the buyer currently spends:
- readiness engagements
- ongoing advisory retainers
- extra audit support due to messy evidence

Model as:
- `consulting_savings = current_consulting_spend * conservative_reduction_pct`
- Use **10-25%** as a conservative reduction range unless you have customer proof.

### 3.2 Downside-Risk Avoided (Expected Value)

This is best framed as **expected value** (probability-weighted), not guaranteed avoidance.

Examples of downside (pick the one that matches the buyer):
- extended audit window (more internal hours + more auditor hours)
- delayed enterprise contract due to security review delays
- regulator enforcement outcomes (NDIS / aged care interventions)

## 4) 1-Page ROI Summary (Copy/Paste)

### FormaOS ROI Summary (AU)

**FormaOS pays for itself if it saves ~4-7 hours/week of compliance admin and audit prep.**

**Modeled buyer profiles (labor-only savings):**

- **Small NDIS provider:** ~**32 hours/month** saved = **$1,760 to $3,520/month** value  
  Subscription target: **$249/month**

- **Mid-size aged care:** ~**135 hours/month** saved = **$7,425 to $14,850/month** value  
  Subscription target: **$499/month**

- **Multi-site org:** ~**560 hours/month** saved = **$30,800 to $61,600/month** value  
  Subscription target: **$899+/month**

**What drives ROI (in practice):**
- evidence chase and reconciliation time collapses
- recurring registers (training/credentials/assets) become continuous, not “audit season”
- incident reporting is traceable to remediation (less rework under scrutiny)
- stakeholder and procurement packs become repeatable deliverables

**Assumptions:**
- Loaded hourly cost: **$55 / $75 / $110**
- Conservative time savings; excludes consulting savings and downside-risk avoided unless explicitly added
