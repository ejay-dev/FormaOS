# 2026-02-12

- Implemented major marketing expansion pages:
  - `/security-review`
  - `/frameworks`
  - `/customer-stories`
  - `/compare` + `/compare/vanta` + `/compare/drata` + `/compare/secureframe`
- Updated marketing IA links:
  - Added Resources dropdown in header navigation.
  - Added new pages to footer resource/platform link groups.
  - Expanded Trust Center to point into Security Review, Frameworks, and Compare flows.
- Added new server-backed org-scoped search endpoint:
  - `GET /api/search` (policies, tasks, evidence; rate-limited and permission-gated).
- Upgraded app search UX:
  - `TopbarSearch` now consumes `/api/search` instead of direct client-side table queries.
  - Command palette now supports dynamic workspace results in app context.
- Upgraded admin UX:
  - Added `AdminQuickSearch` in top bar (scope switch: orgs/users).
  - Added command palette into admin layout.
  - Command palette is now context-aware (`/admin` vs `/app`) with admin-specific command groups and no org-scoped search call in admin context.
- Upgraded employer dashboard UX:
  - Added `PriorityActionQueue` section to push operator-critical next actions.
- Dev workflow reliability fixes:
  - Added `tsconfig.typecheck.json`.
  - Updated `npm run type-check` to use dedicated typecheck config so it does not depend on `.next/types` state.
- Validation completed:
  - `npm run typecheck` passes.
  - `npm run build` passes.
  - `npm run lint` passes with pre-existing warnings only (0 errors).
