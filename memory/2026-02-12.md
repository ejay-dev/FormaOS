- Implemented major marketing expansion pages:
  - `/security-review`

  - Added new pages to footer resource/platform link groups.
  - Expanded Trust Center to point into Security Review, Frameworks, and Compare flows.
- Added new server-backed org-scoped search endpoint:

  - `TopbarSearch` now consumes `/api/search` instead of direct client-side table queries.

- Upgraded admin UX:
  - Added `AdminQuickSearch` in top bar (scope switch: orgs/users).

- Upgraded employer dashboard UX:
  - Added `PriorityActionQueue` section to push operator-critical next actions.
- Dev workflow reliability fixes:
  - Added `tsconfig.typecheck.json`.

  - Expanded trust center page with a structured trust workflow (Evaluate → Validate → Accelerate) for enterprise review gates.

- Validation after this batch:
  - `npm run typecheck` pass
  - `npm run lint` pass (warnings only)
