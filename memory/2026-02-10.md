- User positioned me as lead engineer for the FormaOS project and requested full-stack audits (architecture, security, performance, auth/onboarding, admin dashboard, compliance) plus an improvement roadmap.
- Confirmed the full FormaOS repo lives at /Users/ejay/formaos; produced a detailed enterprise audit covering go-live blockers (multi-org support gap, CSP looseness, admin security), priority fixes, security/perf findings, onboarding/admin wiring issues, and a final QA checklist.
- Follow-up work likely includes implementing the multi-org selection flow, hardening CSP + admin actions (CSRF, service-role usage), improving monitoring/CI, and replacing the placeholder README with accurate setup docs.
